# Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Using Blockchain
A supply chain for the safe distribution of medicines using Blockchain.
## âœ¨ Motivation
At present, counterfeit drugs pose a serious threat as it is difficult for people to know the true value of purchased medicines due to a significant lack of transparency in the current system. Also, tampering within the supply chain is difficult to investigate when suspicion of illegal or unethical practices.
## âš¡ Our Solution
Our solution is an amalgamation of two powerful technologies - Blockchain. Blockchain is an open, distributed ledger that can efficiently record transactions between two parties in a verifiable and permanent way. Since blockchains are decentralized, distributed, transparent, and immutable, they can easily solve counterfeit medicines.
<br><br>
This project proposes a system that uses blockchain for the safe supply of medical drugs throughout the supply chain. Each product within the chain can be transferred between authenticated entities of the chain using an event request-response mechanism. All transactions between entities are recorded into the blockchain using smart contracts with the help of which a product can be traced to its source.
## ðŸ‘€ Getting Started
### To deploy the Smart Contract
- Install Ganache and create a workspace.
- Install Truffle npm package globally by running npm install -g truffle.
- In the truffle-config.js file update the from: address to an address from your Ganache workspace.
- Run truffle migrate --reset from the command line to deploy the smart contract to the blockchain.
- Download Metamask Chrome extension for the browser to help interaction between the application and the blockchain.
